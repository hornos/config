# 
# routefilter - Turn on kernel route filtering for this interface i.e. turn on anti-spoofing measurements.
#
# blacklist - Check packets arriving on this interface against the /etc/shorewall/blacklist file. 
# The blacklist file is used to perform static blacklisting. 
# You can blacklist by source address (IP or MAC), or by application.
#
# tcpflags - Packets arriving on this interface are checked for certain illegal combinations of TCP flags such 
# as x mas or null or invalid packets. Packets found to have such a combination of flags are dropped (see the 
# settings of TCP_FLAGS_DISPOSITION option in shorewall.conf) after having been logged in /var/log/messages 
# file (see the setting of TCP_FLAGS_LOG_LEVEL in shorewall.conf).
#
# logmartians - Turn on kernel martian logging (logging of packets with impossible source addresses). It is 
# strongly suggested that if you set routefilter on an interface that you also set logmartians.
#
# nosmurfs - Filter packets for smurfs (packets with a broadcast address as the source) i.e. 
# turn on anti-smurf protection.
